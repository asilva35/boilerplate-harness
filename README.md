# boilerplate-harness

An educational, progressive Node.js/TypeScript boilerplate for learning **harness engineering** — the scaffolding layer around an LLM (agent loop, tools, permissions, context compaction, commands, UI) that turns it into a useful agent.

Built phase by phase, one commit per phase, so the git history itself doubles as a walkthrough: check out any commit to see the project at that exact stage.

## Requirements

- **Node.js ≥ 20**.
- An API key from **Anthropic** ([console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)) or **OpenRouter** ([openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)) — whichever you have on hand. OpenRouter is the fallback if your card isn't accepted directly by Anthropic (happens in some countries); it gives access to the same Claude models through a proxy.

## Setup

```sh
nvm use   # if you use nvm — installs/activates the version in .nvmrc
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # and fill in your API key there
```

## Run

```sh
npm start          # plain console REPL
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
```

## Phase 1: Base Config and Minimal Viable Product (REPL, no tools)

**Key concept:** understanding the basic message exchange (User/Assistant) in a conversation, with history kept in memory.

- `tsx` for direct TypeScript execution, no manual compile step.
- A `Provider` abstraction (`src/provider/`) with two interchangeable adapters (Anthropic, OpenRouter) — nothing else in the harness ever imports either SDK directly.
- A plain `while (true)` loop reading from `process.stdin` via `readline/promises`.

Try it: run `npm start` and hold a multi-turn conversation to confirm the `messages` array keeps context across turns.

## Phase 2: Agent Loop and Basic Tool Calling

**Key concept:** the *Agent Loop* pattern. The LLM decides when to answer the user directly and when to request a local function call.

- `Tool` type and Zod schema to validate arguments (`src/tools/types.ts`).
- `read_file` and `write_file` tools using `node:fs/promises`.
- The `Agent` (`src/agent.ts`) processes `stop_reason === "tool_use"` responses: it executes the local tool and feeds the result back in a `user`-role message with `tool_result` content.

Try it: ask the agent *"Create a file called test.txt with the phrase 'Hello from my agent' and then read it back to confirm its content."*

## Phase 3: Permission Gate and Shell Command Execution

**Key concept:** safety and inspection. Controlling the execution of potentially destructive commands before they run.

- `bash` tool using `node:child_process.spawn`.
- The agent loop pauses before executing tools flagged as risky (`requiresConfirmation`) to ask for explicit `[y/N]` confirmation on the console.

Try it: ask the agent to run `ls -la` or install an npm package, and confirm the CLI pauses execution to ask for your approval.

## Phase 4: Context Management, Sliding Window, and Slash Commands

**Key concept:** handling token-limit overhead (*context window overhead*) and harness control commands.

- Intercepts input starting with `/` (`/help`, `/clear`, `/compact`, `/history`).
- A truncation/compaction strategy keeps the system prompt and the most recent messages once a token-usage threshold is crossed.

Try it: run `/compact` in the CLI and see the message array shrink without losing the essential state.

More phases land here as the project grows — see the commit history for the full progression.
